# Basic Blackjack Rules:

* The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
* Face cards are worth 10. Aces are worth 1 or 11, whichever makes a better hand.
* You start with two cards, dealer start with one card.
* To 'Hit' is to ask for another card. To 'Stand' is to hold your total and end your turn.
* If you go over 21 you bust, and the dealer wins regardless of the dealer's hand.
* If you are dealt 21 from the start (Ace & 10), you got a blackjack. You win 1.5 the amount of your bet.
* If dealer has blackjack as well, it is a tie.
* Dealer will hit until his cards total 17 or higher. He must hit on soft 17
* A soft 17 includes an Ace being counted as 11. Ace-6 is a soft 17, as are Ace-2-4, Ace-3-3, Ace-Ace-5 and others.
* Doubling is like a hit, only the bet is doubled and you only get one more card.
* Split can be done when you have two of the same card - the pair is split into two hands. 
* There is no blackjack after split. You can split up to three times to create four hands.
* Splitting also doubles the bet, because each new hand is worth the original bet.
* You can only double/split on the first move, or first move of a hand created by a split.
* You cannot play on two aces after they are split.You receive just one extra card on each ace.
* You can double on a hand resulting from a split.

## What is insurance bet?
* In blackjack, insurance is a side bet which is separate to your original stake.
* Offered only when the dealer's first card is an ace, it acts as a safety net against an opposing blackjack.
* An insurance bet is up to half your original wager and pays 2 to 1.
* The insurance bet is completed when the dealer draw second card.
* If it's a ten, jack, queen or king, the dealer will make a blackjack and you will win the insurance bet.
* If not, you will lose the insurance bet and depending on your hand, may still win your original stake.
